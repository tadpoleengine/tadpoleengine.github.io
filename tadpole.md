rostrum becomes tadpole
===

After some deliberation, I have decided to open source the core functionality of rostrum and rebrand to Tadpole Engine. Since my work on this project is (sort of) funded by my hobby business Pollywog Games, it seems thematically appropriate.

Check out the [project page](https://github.com/lwb4/tadpole) on Github! There's still a ton of gaps, and I need to actually put my code in that repository, but the skeleton is there.

My primary reason for making this project open source is to solicit help from other game developers. I don't have anywhere near the skills or the available free time to make this project into everything that I envision it to be, so I am opening it up to the world and inviting contributions from anyone who is interested. This may mean I have to compromise on my vision a little bit, but that is a price I'm willing to pay if it means that I'll actually have something at the end of this instead of just some files on my hard drive.

Let me know what you think. My primary forum for communicating with other developers on this project will be Github Issues, although it's likely that I'll also add a channel to the Pollywog Games Discord server for real time chat.
